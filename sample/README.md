# AMPi Sample

A sample program demonstrating AMPi usage. Only works on
Raspberry Pi 1/0/0W.

To build, run:

```sh
make -j4
```

This will produce the image _kernel.img_.

The program plays a sine wave at 344.5 Hz for 2.97 seconds,
sleeps for 2 seconds, and repeats indefinitely. (These
numbers are not completely arbitrary and the reason behind
them is left to the reader as an exercise.)

### Ogg mode!

Find a **stereo** Ogg file with a length not exceeding 380
seconds and not too large in size â€” 16 MiB is completely safe.
Copy it to this directory and build with a flag:

```sh
cp path/to/music.ogg music.ogg
OGG=1 make -j4
```

On startup, the Act LED is turned on while the data is being
decoded, and when the LED goes off the audio will start to play.

Parts of the environment is taken from Circle and simplified
a lot.

this to other models, please get in touch through an issue
